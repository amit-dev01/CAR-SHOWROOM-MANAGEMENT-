Car Showroom Management System 🚗
A lightweight desktop application built using Java and Swing API. This project was developed to understand the practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and event-driven GUI development.

📌 Project Overview
The Car Showroom Management System is designed to handle basic showroom operations. It allows users to manage car inventory through a graphical interface, making it easier to add, view, and track vehicle details compared to a standard console-based application.

Key Features:-
Add Vehicle: Input details such as Model, Brand, Price, and Year.

Inventory Display: View a list of all cars currently in the showroom.

Dynamic Search: (If implemented) Filter cars by brand or model.

User-Friendly GUI: Built with Java Swing for a smooth desktop experience.

🛠️ Technical Stack:-
Language: Java (JDK 25)
GUI Library: Java Swing & AWT
IDE used:IntelliJ IDEA 

Future Roadmap :-
As I continue my learning journey, I plan to add the following enhancements:
[ ] Database Integration: Connect to MySQL using JDBC for permanent data storage.
[ ] File Handling: Export showroom reports to PDF or Excel files.
[ ] Login System: Add an Authentication screen for showroom managers.
[ ] UI Styling: Enhance the visual look using advanced Swing layouts or CSS-like styling.
